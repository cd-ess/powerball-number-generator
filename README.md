# Powerball Number Generator

*DISCLAIMER: If you buy a powerball ticket and use this to pikc your numbers, and you do not win, I will NOT be taking responsibility for the money you spent on a ticket.*

*DISCLAIMER #2: If you DO win, then I am more open minded to taking responsibility and you can send me some of the winnings if you feel inclined.*

This is just a very simple powerball number generator that I made for a friend who hates having to choose their own numbers. There is no UI it just prints your numbers in the terminal of your IDE.

If you don't know the rules for powerball, the first five numbers are 1-69 with no repeats and the special powerball number is 1-26 and can be a repeat of one of the first five. Thats it.
